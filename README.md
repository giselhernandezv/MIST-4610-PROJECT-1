**Problem Description**

Our team decided to model a database that administrates, schedules, handles operations of the NCAA Football. In our groupâ€™s projects, we made 12 entities that describe the scenario previously stated. The 12 entities also show the relationships between one another that helped build the complete data model. From our perspective, we decided that players, coaches, and the team aligned with one another for the managing aspect along with tracking player statistics with their corresponding season. While the NCAA does handle, these are only the championship tickets. From a backend perspective,we made a way to handle financial transactions of tickets and sponsorships for games not including championship. We also included a way to maintain stadium information and its ticket sales as well as its handling of broadcasting and broadcasters of each game. This model demonstrates how this key importance of handling regular game tickets is valuable for them and their operations.
